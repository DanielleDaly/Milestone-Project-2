# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock 

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an adaptation of the original Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This became known from the TV show 'The Big Bang Theory'. It is a game of chance where 2 players choose a variable and reveal it at the same time. If the players tie, then they must play again until there is a winner. With the additional options of 'Lizard' and 'Spock' this allows for more possible outcomes than the original game and less chance of it ending in a tie.
